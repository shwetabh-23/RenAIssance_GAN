# RenAIssance_GAN

Reproducing Renaissance-style printed text is challenging due to its intricate typography, irregular ink distribution, and historical printing artifacts like ink bleed and smudging. Achieving authentic formatting effects, such as uneven spacing and faded impressions, adds further complexity. Traditional generative models struggle to capture these details, as each artifact requires specific loss functions, often conflicting and destabilizing training. Balancing realism and artifact accuracy is difficult, leading to mode collapse or unrealistic outputs. Additionally, historical text datasets are limited, making model training even harder. Overcoming these challenges requires careful loss balancing, high-quality datasets, and specialized architectures for degradation simulation.

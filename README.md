# RenAIssance_GAN

Renaissance Text Generator

This project aims to generate synthetic Renaissance-style printed text images using generative models (GANs) with realistic degradation effects such as ink bleed, smudging, and faded characters. The pipeline includes text preprocessing, dataset creation, model training, and inference with custom degradation simulation.

ðŸš€ Features
	â€¢	Generate Renaissance-style text with realistic printing artifacts
 
	â€¢	Support for multiple degradation types
 
	â€¢	Modular pipeline for training and inference
 
	â€¢	Preprocessing and formatting of historical Spanish texts
 
	â€¢	Edge and texture simulation utilities
 
	â€¢	Support for training with L1 and custom loss functions
